Difference Between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA


<================JPA=============>
JPA stands for Java Persistence API.

It is a specification (not a library or framework).

It defines how to interact with relational databases using Java objects.

JPA provides annotations like @Entity, @Id, and APIs like EntityManager.

It does not do any actual work — it needs an implementation like Hibernate.

<========Hibernate============>
Hibernate is a framework and a popular implementation of JPA.

It takes care of the actual database interaction.

It provides extra features not present in JPA (e.g., caching, batch processing).

You can use Hibernate with or without JPA.

<=======Spring Data JPA======>
Spring Data JPA is a Spring-based library that builds on top of JPA and Hibernate.

It makes database operations much easier by removing boilerplate code.

You don’t need to write SQL or even EntityManager code — you just define repository interfaces.

It provides methods like save(), findById(), and findAll() automatically.
